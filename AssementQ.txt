Case Study: Terraform Implementation for AWS Infrastructure 
Overview 
In this case study, you'll explore the implementation of Terraform to create AWS 
instances, VPCs, S3 buckets, IAM users, and subnets. The focus will be on using 
variables, data types, count, functions, workspaces, and modules. 
Objectives 
1.Set up AWS infrastructure using Terraform. 
2.Create AWS instances, VPCs, S3 buckets, IAM users, and subnets. 
3.Utilize Terraform features such as variables, functions, and count. 
4.Manage configurations for different environments using workspaces. 
5.Organize code using modules. 
Step 1: Setting Up Providers 
Configure the AWS provider using different profiles for each environment. 
Step 2: Defining Variables and Data Types 
Define variables to manage your configuration. 
Step 3: Using Functions 
Use Terraform functions to manipulate data, such as creating environment-specific 
tags. 
Step 4: Utilizing Count 
Use the count parameter to create multiple instances or resources. 
Step 5: Utilizing Data Sources 
Fetch information about existing resources using data sources. 
Step 6: Managing Workspaces 
Use Terraform workspaces to manage different environments. 
Step 7: Organizing Code with Modules 
 
Organize and reuse code by creating and using modules. 
Step 8: Applying the Configuration 
Apply the configuration to create the infrastructure. 
Detailed Steps 
Step 1: Setting Up Providers 
Configure the AWS provider with variables for region and profile. 
Step 2: Defining Variables and Data Types 
Define variables for VPC CIDR, instance type, bucket and iam user names 
Step 3: Using Functions 
Create variables to convert input from user to lowercase or upper case to compare with variables. 
Step 4: Utilizing Count 
Use the count parameter to create multiple instances, S3 buckets, or IAM users. 
Step 5: Utilizing Data Sources 
Use data sources to fetch id details of an existing iam user from aws 
Step 6: Managing Workspaces 
Create and switch between different workspaces for development, staging, and production. 
Step 7: Organizing Code with Modules 
Create modules for VPC, instances, S3 buckets, IAM users, and subnets. All above configuration should be written in modules 
and then used to create entire infrastructure. 
Step 8: Applying the Configuration 
Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration. 
Conclusion 
By following these steps, you will be able to effectively use Terraform to manage 
AWS infrastructure, leveraging variables, functions, count, data sources, 
workspaces, and modules to create a scalable and maintainable infrastructure as 
code setup.
